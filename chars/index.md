- <span class="eng">Meow-sieur Chef is a cook, and he makes dishes for all the carnivores and bears in the Bear Resort.

- <span class="eng">Simba is the pet cat of Zhaizhai. Apart from being absolutely adorable, Simba also has his own preciousness in terms of scientific research: Simba's trajectory contains a perfectly random component and nobody knows where he would jump to at the next time step, so his movements serve as a perfect source for simulations of Brownian motions, which happens to be something that Mathy and Mousy have been researching on.</span> <span class="chn">辛巴是宅宅的宠物。除了每日卖萌以外，辛巴是科研界名副其实的瑰宝：他的运动轨迹包含一个绝对随机的部分且没有任何人知道他下一刻会窜到什么地方。因此，他的动作是模拟布朗运动的绝佳资源，而这又是数数和鼠鼠长久以来的研究方向。</span>
