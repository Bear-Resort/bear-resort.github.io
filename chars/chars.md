Upon its establishment, the Bear Resort has been the habitant of various creatures. Here are the ones we have adopted. 

自建立伊始，小熊樂園便是许多生灵的栖息之所。这是我们现有的一些成员。

## The Ursalinos <br> 熊手党

- Beary (小熊)
    - Beary is a Brown bear ([*Ursus arctos*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_bear)), and he is the head of the Ursalinos. <br> 小熊是一头棕熊，他也是熊手党的族长。
    - Beary is a senior technician and associate professor in the BIAS (Bear Institute of Aeronautics and Space), where he serves as a faculty of pure mathematics and astrophysics. His research interests are upon the application of algebraic topology on multiscale structure in the universe. <br> 小熊是BIAS(熊熊航空航天局)的高级技师和副教授，也是纯数系和天体物理系的教员。他的研究主要在代数拓扑学在多尺度结构宇宙中的应用。

- Little Bear (小小熊)
    - Little Bear is also a Brown bear ([*Ursus arctos*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_bear)), and he is the son of Beary. <br> 小小熊也是一头棕熊，他是小熊的儿子。
    - Little Bear is a problem kid in the Bear Resort, as he always causes troubles around. However, every time when he messes around, his innocent eyes and adorable emotions always condone him from penalties. <br> 小小熊是小熊樂園里的问题青年，因为他处处闯祸。尽管如此，每当他搞砸了，他的无辜眼神和可爱表情总能为他脱罪。

- Dr. B (胖胖博士) ([*Survey Results / 问卷结果*](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdzFX4EANLZvD9Y2l2mYN_56jX23oaFzY7fUjT8BAuToITpKQ/viewanalytics?usp=form_confirm))
    - Dr. B is a Giant panda ([*Ailuropoda melanoleuca*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_panda)). He owns a dual identity, serving in both the Ursalinos and the Meowstars. <br> 胖胖博士是一头大熊猫。他拥有双重身份，同属于熊手党和喵星人。
    - Dr. B is a workout fanatic and is also a doctor (although we don’t know if he possesses a medical degree, or Doctor of Philosophy, or both). He enjoys and struggles to be the big guy. He also has a benzene reactor on his chest that he rarely takes off... <br> 胖胖博士酷愛健身，沒人知道他是医生或是博士，又或许都是？作为一个大家伙，他既享受又烦恼。他胸部裝著一個高級苯反應堆，只是他几乎從不取下它。

- More Ursalinos members coming soon.

## Meowstars <br> 喵星人

- Meow-sieur Chef (神厨咪咪) ([*Survey Results / 问卷结果*](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeSW_F1lZ-YPX4SVYt6Ryv5MRwZlF0ktrK1k7WABXoYVraSNQ/viewanalytics?usp=form_confirm))
    - Meow-sieur Chef is a South China Tiger ([*P. t. amoyensis*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_China_tiger)). As the King of Beasts, he is undoubtfully the head of the Meowstars. <br> 神厨咪咪是一头华南虎。作为百兽之王，他毋庸置疑是喵星人的族长。
    - Meow-sieur Chef is a cook, and he makes dishes for all the carnivores and bears in the Bear Resort. Absolutely marvelous control of knifes, so one should suspect what he does before becoming a chief. FYI: You'd better call him by Big Justin (which appeared to be on his ID, probably) rather than Meow-sieur (his nickname), unless you are absolutely sure that you will not become his breakfast tomorrow. <br> 神厨咪咪是一个厨子，他为小熊樂園里的各个食肉动物和熊们准备餐点。绝佳的刀工，让人不得不怀疑他在做厨子之前干的是什么行当。小贴士：你最好叫他的真名-大哥贾斯汀，而非小名咪咪，除非你绝对知道你不会成为他明天的早餐。
